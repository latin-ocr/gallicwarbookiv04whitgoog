successive half-year or term; so that a book
needlessly large and proportionably expensive is
laid aside after a short and but partia] use.

In order, therefore, to meet what is certainly a
want, Portions of the Classical Writers usually
read in Sehools are now being issued under the

to add to the series some portions of the Greek
T estament.

Each Tsxr is provided with a VocABannv of
